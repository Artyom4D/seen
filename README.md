### A 3D Javascript Library


## What's this all about?
seen.js is a standalone library for rendering simple 3D models in Javascript. It performs 3D to 2D transformations in code and renders to either SVG or HTML5 Canvases for broad compatibility.


## Features
* Phong reflection model with ambient, diffuse, and specular terms.
* Perspective and orthographic projections.
* Pixel-for-pixel viewport alignment in the Z=0 plane for easy layout.
* Point, directional, and ambient light sources.
* Hierarchical models, lighting, and transformations.
* Renders to HTML5 Canvas elements for speed, or to SVG paths for compatibility.
* Simple, fast painters algorithm for Z-ordering.
* 3D Transformed text (when using orthographic projections).
* Interaction including quaternion based mouse rotations.
* Modular class structure for maximum readability and extensibility.
* No dependencies (except for demos).


## Render Loop Optimizations
* Minimal object creation
* JIT hierarchical transformation multiplication


## Rendering Pipeline
3D model definition:
* Model -> Lights, Shape -> Surface -> Shader, Material, Points
Camera definition:
* Camera -> Projection, Viewport
Render event hierarchy:
* Context -> Renderer -> RenderLayer -> Painter


## Demos
Install nodejs from here ().
Clone this repo and start the demo server on http://localhost:5000 like so:
  npm install
  cake build
  npm start
